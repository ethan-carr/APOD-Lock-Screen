Instructions for using the APOD-Lockscreen program:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    Note: This version is made for Python3.9

2. Double-click on the setup.py file to run it.
    Note: Running the setup.py file will install the necessary dependencies for the program to run.

3. Once the setup is complete, navigate to the program folder (default in Documents/APOD-Lockscreen) and locate the background_changer.bat file.

4. Right-click on the apod_lockscreen.bat file and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.
    Note: Running the batch script as administrator is required in order for the program to be able to change the lock screen image.

5. The program will now run and automatically change your lock screen image to NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day daily. No other interaction is required.

To stop and remove the program simply delete the "APOD-Lockscreen" folder in Documents and then remove the "APOD-Lockscreen" task in Task Scheduler.
